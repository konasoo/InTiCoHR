# InTiCoR

We developed a network analysis method to find Inter-Tissue Communicators from heterogeneous network by Random walk with Restart (InTiCoR).

This repository shares a executable tool to run InTiCOHR for the user's choice of network, inter-tissue communicators, and genes of interest (e.g. disease genes).

## Systems Requirements

Python version

- 'python' == 3.8.11

Required packages

- 'pandas' ==
- 'scipy' ==

## Input Files Descriptions

The following files are required to run InTiCoHR for the interested researchers:

- 'network_file.csv' - The network to run the analysis from. (Delimiter: | )
- 'inter_tissue_communicators.csv' - A list of potential inter-tissue communicators. Examples provided.
- 'genes_of_interest.csv' -
