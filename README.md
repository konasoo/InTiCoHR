# InTiCoR

We developed a network analysis method to find Inter-Tissue Communicators from heterogeneous network by Random walk with Restart (InTiCoR).

This repository shares a executable tool to run InTiCOHR for the user's choice of network, inter-tissue communicators, and genes of interest (e.g. disease genes).

## Systems Requirements

Python version

- 'python' == 3.8.18

Required packages

- 'pandas' == 1.5.3
- 'scipy' == 1.10.1
- 'numpy' == 1.24.3
- 'networkx' == 3.1

## Input Files Descriptions

The following files are required to run InTiCoHR for the interested researchers: </br>
The delimeters for all files are '|'. </br>
The example files are provided in the directory "prep_files". </br>
You can simply prepare your own version of files as needed, and add their file names as arguments when running InTiCoR.

The input arguments are the following:

- <strong>'background_network' (-b)</strong> </br> The network to run the analysis from. All the gene pairs need to be in ENSG IDs. </br> Refer to 'example_network.csv' for the required format.

- <strong>disease_genes_of_interest (-g)</strong> </br> A list of genes that you would like to search the related ITCs for. </br> Refer to 'example_GOI.csv' for the required format.

- <strong>disease_genes_full_collection (-d)</strong> </br> A dataframes with the prior knowledge-based disease genes. </br> We recommend using the file provided (i.e. "DiseaseGenes_parsed.csv") with the genes for 265 diseases. </br> Refer to 'DiseaseGenes_parsed.csv' for the required format.

- <strong>modified_z_threshold (-t)</strong> </br> The threshold to use for the modified z-score to find ITCs specific to your gene of interest. </br> Default set as 5.

- <strong>parallel_num (-p)</strong> </br> A number of cores to use for the parallel processing. </br> Default set as 50.
  </br>

## The example command to run InTiCoR: </br>

./run_inticor.py -b {dir_for_network}/my_network.csv -g {dir_for_gene_of_interest}/my_GOI.csv -p 20
